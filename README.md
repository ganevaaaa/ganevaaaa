Hi 👋 My name is Gabriela Ganeva
================================

I'm a Computer Science student passionate about cybersecurity and practical problem-solving. I enjoy building tools that simulate real-world threats, like my Python-based web vulnerability scanner. Through hands-on projects, I'm developing skills in network security, secure coding, and threat analysis.

I'm also a strong believer in learning by doing — whether it's scripting automation in Python, breaking things in test environments, or discussing attack surfaces over coffee. My goal is to work as a cybersecurity consultant — helping organizations identify risks, strengthen their defenses, and build secure systems from the ground up.

I like working on projects that have real-world impact and help strengthen digital security. I'm always eager to collaborate, share knowledge, and keep learning from others in the field.

*   🚀  I'm currently working on [Web vulnerability scanner](http://github.com/ganevaaaa/web-vuln-scanner)
*   🧠  I'm learning Web application security , threat modeling (STRIDE)and security standards like ISO/IEC 27001. Tools: Burp Suite, Nmap, Nikto, Wireshark
*   🤝  I'm open to collaborating on Cool cybersecurity side quests, consulting-style audit projects,building hacker tools, or anything that breaks stuff (legally)
