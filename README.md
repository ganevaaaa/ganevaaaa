Hi 👋 My name is Gabriela 

I'm a Computer Science student passionate about cybersecurity and practical problem-solving. I enjoy building tools that simulate real-world threats, like my Python-based web vulnerability scanner. Through hands-on projects, I'm developing skills in network security, secure coding, and threat analysis.


I like working on projects that have real-world impact and help strengthen digital security. I'm always eager to collaborate, share knowledge, and keep learning from others in the field.

*   🚀  I'm currently working on [Web vulnerability scanner](http://github.com/ganevaaaa/web-vuln-scanner)
*   🧠  I'm learning Web application security , threat modeling (STRIDE) and  ISO/IEC 27001.
*   🧐 Currently exploring GUI development with Python and PySide6 to complement my backend and security experience.
*   🤝  I'm open to collaborating on cool cybersecurity side quests, consulting-style audit projects, building  tools, or anything that breaks stuff (legally)
